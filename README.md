Chat with your Cyber Threat Intelligence data with AzureÂ OpenAI

Use case description.
The goal is to develop a chatbot using Azure OpenAI to engage in conversations with your intelligence data sourced from Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (MDTI). I've leveraged SharePoint Online as a document repository to programmatically and automatically ingest MDTI articles, indicators, and threat actor profiles. This automation harnesses MDTI APIs invoked by Azure Logic App.
By utilizing an Azure OpenAI instance and deploying a GPT-4 model, I've created a straightforward web application for conversing with the gathered threat intelligence data. Please note that this is a specific use case that involves the availability of MDTI (which can be enabled for trial, as described here). Alternatively, or to expand the use case, you can incorporate intelligence data from any source, such as OSINT, cybersecurity vendors, community sources, email data, national CERTs, and more.
The strength of Large Language Models (LLMs) lies in their proficiency with unstructured data and files in multiple formats. Particularly with Azure OpenAI, you can be assured of secure data management, ensuring that data is not shared with any external parties and aligning with privacy regulations and international standards
